log collector -> queue -> stream processor -> index, serach and visualization
                                           -> monitoring and alert engine
                                           -> mining (classification, clustering etc.)
I am not here to re-invent the wheel. Most of the components mentioned above are well implemented already and if not I will implement that. Although making a correct choice is critical.

1. Log Collector
  lumberjack
  log4j appenders
  rsyslogd
  
2. Queue
  redis
  ActiveMQ
  Kafka
  
3. Stream Processor
  storm 

4. Index, Search and Visualization
  elastic search
  kibana
  
5. Monitoring and Alert
  esmon
  
6. Mining
  essmart
